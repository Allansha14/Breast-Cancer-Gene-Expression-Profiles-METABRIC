The dataset, sourced from METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv, undergoes thorough preprocessing to handle missing values and streamline feature selection. Missing values are managed through methods like median and mode imputation, ensuring data integrity. The K-means clustering algorithm is then applied to identify inherent patterns within the data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using both the elbow method and silhouette scores, aiding in effective cluster segmentation. To enhance clustering accuracy, feature normalization techniques such as Min-Max and Standardization are employed. Additionally, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized for dimensionality reduction, facilitating visualization of clusters in a lower-dimensional space. Insights into feature importance and cluster-specific feature ranges are extracted, providing a deeper understanding of the data's structure and highlighting significant variables within each cluster. This comprehensive approach ensures robust clustering results and meaningful interpretations for further analysis.
